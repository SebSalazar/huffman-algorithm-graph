# Huffman algorithm - graph tree

This program do all process of encoded for a chain of text by huffman algorithm also it's show the details of encoded, like:

- Size in bits of chain without compress
- Binary coding for each letter of the chain
- Bits compress and his bit saving
- Lastly all encrypted message
- Also the program do the decoding process

# Coding tree

To encode the message it is done with a tree structure, this tree is generated with 

* **Graphviz2.38**
